# Face-Mask-Detection
In this project we will  build a Face Mask Detector using Keras, Tensorflow, MobileNet and OpenCV.

This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.
